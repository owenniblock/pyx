# pyx
A HoloLens application for helping comedians (and other performers) on stage.

## Features:
- Allows audience members to suggest actions & vote on whether those actions were successful or not.

## Notes on build decisions
- The API is being written as a lightweight .Net Core API.
- We're going to build the UI on the HoloLens using 3d shapes - if that turns out to be a bit too complex for this first proof of concept - we'll fall back to using UWP.
